    <h1>Personal Details</h1>
    <p>My name is <b>OGUNLADE TIMILEHIN OLUWASEUN</b>, an undergraduate student of Federal University of Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria.
    I am currently studying Criminology and Security Studies. </p>
    <p>I love tech and security. My love for tech started when I was in the junior secondary school and this made me created different website using blogspot and wordpress. I have always wanted to learn how to create my own website because it looks like magic to me seeing websites on the internet but I dont know how to go about it. Due to limited knowledge about tech that I had back then, I was unable to do something meaningful with the curiousity I have in my mind. </p>
    <p>Fast forward to a year after secondary school, I begin to make more enquires about how to develop a website and I was able to get two applications (mimo and solo learn) where I will be able to learn web development with my smartphone. I was happy and I begin to learn the basic of html. </p>
    <p>I later came across a learning platform, and I joined because I love community and I want to interact with other developer. When I resumed University, I was unable to meet up with the learn process due to school stress because I was a fresher then.</p>
    <p>I began to use my twitter to interact with other developers and i came across on Instagram, it was FALZ advertisement that I saw, but I later register with LAYI's coupon code</p>
